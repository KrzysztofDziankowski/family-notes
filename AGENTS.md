# Repository Guidelines

FamilyNotes is a Django 5.2 web application managed with `uv`. The repository currently contains the project scaffold; use `@context/foundation/prd.md` for product behavior and `@context/foundation/tech-stack.md` for the delivery assumptions.

## Hard Rules

- Never write to `context/archive/`; archived changes are immutable. If a resolved target is archived, stop and open a new change under `context/changes/`.
- Enforce family-scoped access in every query and mutation. Parents may manage family entries, children may read only entries assigned to them, and unauthenticated users may not access family data; see `@context/foundation/prd.md`.
- Keep classification input limited to producing and saving the requested family entry. Do not add secondary storage, analytics, or training use for that text.
- Keep secrets and deployment-specific values out of source control. Replace the scaffolded development values in `@family_notes/settings.py` with environment-backed configuration before deployment.

## Commands

- `uv sync` installs dependencies from `@uv.lock`.
- `uv run python manage.py runserver` starts the local Django server.
- `uv run python manage.py check` runs Django's system checks.
- `uv run python manage.py test` runs the Django test suite.
- `uv run python manage.py makemigrations --check --dry-run` detects model changes without migrations.
- `uv run --locked pip-audit` audits locked dependencies.

## Project Structure

- `family_notes/` contains project settings, root URLs, and ASGI/WSGI entry points.
- `manage.py` is the Django command entry point and uses `family_notes.settings`.
- `context/foundation/` contains living product and stack decisions. Edit those documents in place when decisions change.
- `context/changes/<change-id>/` contains change-scoped work; follow `@context/changes/README.md`.

## Development Conventions

- Keep `family_notes/` limited to project-wide configuration and URL composition; place product models, views, forms, and tests in their owning Django apps.
- For every data visibility or mutation path, test parent access, assigned-child access, another child's access, and unauthenticated access as applicable.
- Treat the MVP boundaries and unresolved classification cases in `@context/foundation/prd.md` as authoritative; do not silently expand deferred features.

## Commits and Verification

Recent history uses short imperative summaries such as `Add prd.md` and `Update skills m1l4`; match that style. Before handing off, run the relevant focused tests plus Django checks and the migration check. Run `uv run --locked pip-audit` after dependency changes.
