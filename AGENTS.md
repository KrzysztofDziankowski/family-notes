# Repository Guidelines

FamilyNotes is a Django 5.2 web application managed with `uv`. The repository currently contains the project scaffold; use `@context/foundation/prd.md` for product behavior and `@context/foundation/tech-stack.md` for the delivery assumptions.

## Hard Rules

- Never write to `context/archive/`; archived changes are immutable. If a resolved target is archived, stop and open a new change under `context/changes/`.
- Enforce family-scoped access in every query and mutation. Parents may manage family entries, children may read only entries assigned to them, and unauthenticated users may not access family data; see `@context/foundation/prd.md`.
- Keep classification input limited to producing and saving the requested family entry. Do not add secondary storage, analytics, or training use for that text.
- Keep secrets and deployment-specific values out of source control. Replace the scaffolded development values in `@family_notes/settings.py` with environment-backed configuration before deployment.

## Commands

- `uv sync` installs dependencies from `@uv.lock`.
- `uv run python manage.py runserver` starts the local Django server.
- `uv run python manage.py check` runs Django's system checks.
- `uv run python manage.py test` runs the Django test suite.
- `uv run python manage.py makemigrations --check --dry-run` detects model changes without migrations.
- `uv run --locked pip-audit` audits locked dependencies.

## Project Structure

- `family_notes/` contains project settings, root URLs, and ASGI/WSGI entry points.
- `manage.py` is the Django command entry point and uses `family_notes.settings`.
- `context/foundation/` contains living product and stack decisions. Edit those documents in place when decisions change.
- `context/changes/<change-id>/` contains change-scoped work; follow `@context/changes/README.md`.

## Development Conventions

- Keep `family_notes/` limited to project-wide configuration and URL composition; place product models, views, forms, and tests in their owning Django apps.
- For every data visibility or mutation path, test parent access, assigned-child access, another child's access, and unauthenticated access as applicable.
- Treat the MVP boundaries and unresolved classification cases in `@context/foundation/prd.md` as authoritative; do not silently expand deferred features.

## Commits and Verification

Recent history uses short imperative summaries such as `Add prd.md` and `Update skills m1l4`; match that style. Before handing off, run the relevant focused tests plus Django checks and the migration check. Run `uv run --locked pip-audit` after dependency changes.

## 10xDevs AI Toolkit - Module 2, Lesson 4

Prepare for a harder implementation stream with the **research-backed planning chain**:

```
internal research (/10x-research) + external research (exa.ai, Context7) -> /10x-plan -> /10x-implement -> success
```

The lesson focus is distinguishing internal from external research and using evidence to back planning decisions.

### Task Router - Where to start

| Skill | Use it when |
| --- | --- |
| **Internal research (lesson focus)** | |
| `/10x-research <change-id>` | You need evidence from the existing codebase — patterns, conventions, integration points, or existing implementations. Runs parallel sub-agents over the repo and writes structured findings to `research.md`. |
| **External research (lesson focus)** | |
| exa.ai | You need AI-native web search for library comparisons, best practices, or ecosystem context that the codebase cannot answer. |
| Context7 (`resolve-library-id` → `get-library-docs`) | You need live, current documentation for a specific library or framework. Resolves a library ID first, then fetches relevant doc pages. |
| **Framing spare wheel** | |
| `/10x-frame <change-id>` | The plan won't converge, the plan doesn't deliver expected results, or persistent drift keeps breaking the implementation. Use as an escape hatch on a separate problem (demonstrated on Space Explorers example), not as pre-research ritual. |
| **Planning and execution** | |
| `/10x-plan <change-id>` / `/10x-implement <change-id> phase <n>` | Use the same planning and execution chain from Lesson 2, now with upstream research evidence feeding the plan. |

### Research discipline

- Internal research (`/10x-research`) answers "what does our codebase already do?" — patterns, schemas, conventions, integration points.
- External research (exa.ai, Context7) answers "what should we do?" — library capabilities, API docs, ecosystem best practices.
- Combine both as evidence-backed input to `/10x-plan`. A plan without research evidence on a non-trivial stream is a guess.
- Agent-friendly docs (`llms.txt`, markdown-for-agents, `/md` endpoints) are a quality signal for library selection — libraries that publish agent-readable docs integrate faster.

### `/10x-frame` as spare wheel

Three triggers for reaching for `/10x-frame`:
1. The plan won't converge — research keeps opening more questions instead of narrowing to a contract.
2. The plan doesn't deliver — implementation repeatedly fails to meet success criteria.
3. Persistent drift — the implementation keeps diverging from the plan in ways that suggest the problem was mis-framed.

Demonstrated on a Space Explorers example, not the SRS path. It is an escape hatch, not a mandatory step.

### Paths used by this lesson

- `context/changes/<change-id>/research.md` - internal research output
- `context/changes/<change-id>/frame.md` - framing output when needed
- `context/changes/<change-id>/plan.md` - evidence-backed implementation contract
- `context/foundation/lessons.md` - recurring rules and pitfalls

Skills must not write to `context/archive/`. Archived changes are immutable; if a resolved target path starts with `context/archive/`, abort with: "This change is archived. Open a new change with `/10x-new` instead."
